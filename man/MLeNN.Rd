\usage{
MLeNN(D, TH = 0.5, k = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{mld \code{mldr} object with the multilabel dataset to preprocess}

\item{TH}{threshold for the Hamming Distance in order to consider an instance different to another one. Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{k}{number of nearest neighbours to check for each instance. Defaults to 3.}
}
\value{
An mldr object containing the preprocessed multilabel dataset
}
\description{
This function implements the MLeNN algorithm. It is a preprocessing algorithm for imbalanced multilabel datasets,
whose aim is to identify instances with majoritary labels, and remove its neihgbors which are too different to them, in terms of active labels.
