\source{

\usage{
MLTL(D, TH, neighbors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{mld \code{mldr} object with the multilabel dataset to preprocess}

\item{TH}{threshold for the Hamming Distance in order to consider an instance different to another one.}

\item{neighbors}{Structure with instances and neighbors. If it is empty, it will be calculated by the function}
}
\value{
An mldr object containing the preprocessed multilabel dataset
}
\description{
This function implements the MLTL algorithm. It is a preprocessing algorithm for imbalanced multilabel datasets, whose aim is to identify
tomek links (majoritary instances with a very different neighbor), and remove them. It's like MLeNN, with the number of neighbors being 1.
