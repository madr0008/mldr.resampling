\title{Auxiliary function used by MLSOL and MLUL. For non outlier instances, it aggregates the values of S for each label}
\usage{
getW(D, d, S)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{mld \code{mldr} object with the multilabel dataset to preprocess}

\item{d}{Vector with the instances of the dataset which have one or more label active (ideally, all of them)}

\item{S}{Structure with the proportion of neighbors having an opposite class with respect to an instance and label, normalized by the global class imbalance}
}
\value{
A vector of weights to be considered when oversampling for each instance
}
