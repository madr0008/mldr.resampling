\alias{resample}
\title{Interface function of the package. It executes one or several algorithms, given as strings, and stores the resulting MLDs in arff files}
\usage{
resample(
  D,
  algorithms,
  P = 25,
  k = 3,
  TH = 0.5,
  params,
  outputDirectory = tempdir()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{mld \code{mldr} object with the multilabel dataset to preprocess}

\item{algorithms}{String, or string vector, with the name(s) of the algorithm(s) to be applied.}

\item{P}{Percentage in which the original dataset is increased/decreased, if required by the algorithm(s). Defaults to 25}

\item{k}{Number of neighbors taken into account for each instance, if required by the algorithm(s). Defaults to 3}

\item{TH}{Threshold for the Hamming Distance in order to consider an instance different to another one, if required by the algorithm(s). Defaults to 0.5}

\item{params}{Dataframe with 4 columns: name of the algorithm, P, k and TH, in that order, to execute several algorithms with different values for their parameters}

\item{outputDirectory}{Route with the directory where generated ARFF files will be stored. Defaults to the working directory}
}
\value{
Dataframe with times (in seconds) taken in to execute each algorithm
}
